I added the experimental condition csvs (v2).  These work with the faces folder to present the 
four conditions of face 'recommendations'.

I added the invest files.  The control csvs (v3) should work.  I've uploaded stims at 200 x 200 pixels.
I added Zach as a collaborator - hi Zach!  Thanks for helping out!

Teni To dos: 
(a) Run a couple of participants on the control csv to see whether and how long it 
takes participants to learn the 10 good and 10 bad brand symbols
(b) Send me or upload the [Trust faces] and [Trust faces with finger pointing] images
so that i can prep the experimental csvs

DOH To dos
(a) Once i've the faces, I'll make the experimental csvs
(b) Two new csvs - one with only face-reward link and one with only brand-reward link
